 abstract = {Abstract: A method of calculating the current-temperature relationship of bare overhead lines, given the weather conditions, is presented. Along with a mathematical method, sources of the  values to be used in the calculation are indicated. This standard does not undertake to list actual  temperature-ampacity relationships for a large number of conductors nor does it recommend  appropriately conservative weather conditions for the rating of overhead power lines. It does,  however, provide a standard method for doing such calculations for both constant and variable  conductor current and weather conditions. Keywords: bare overhead lines, current-temperature relationship, IEEE 738},
