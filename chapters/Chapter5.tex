\chapter{Citation and Bibliography}

There are a lot of literature management software in the market, e.g. EndNote, Citavi, Mandeley, etc. Taking Citavi as example, one can add literature and reference sources into this software and exported all references into a bib-file, which can be read by \LaTeX ~ and directly added into the generated pdf-file.
