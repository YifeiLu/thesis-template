\chapter{Acronyms and Abbreviations}

\graphicspath{ {graphics/Chapter6/} }

It is rather handy to use acronyms or abbreviations in your thesis with \LaTeX. As defined in the file \href{acronyms/acronyms.tex}{acronyms.tex}, the first entry of {\color{blue}{\verb|\newacronym|}} command is the key you entered to call the acronym, while the second one is the short-form of this acronym and the third one is long-form.

For example, an entry of acronym is defined as:

{\verb|\newacronym{der}{DER}{Distributed Energy Resouce}|}

To refer the full version of this term for the first time, you may use {\color{blue}{\verb|\gls{der}|}} to get \gls{der} as output, {\color{blue}{\verb|\acrfull{der}|}} give the same result \acrfull{der}, while {\color{blue}{\verb|\acrshort{der}|}} for the short form \acrshort{der} and {\color{blue}{\verb|\acrlong{der}|}} for the long form \acrlong{der}.

If is quite useful to refer an acronym with the plural form and it is quite simple to realize in \LaTeX --- just add ``pl" at the end of one command, e.g. {\color{blue}{\verb|acrfullpl{der}|}}, and the output will be \acrfullpl{der}.
